# Espitenen und Herr Pimponen

Espitenen und Herr Pimponen is a simple yet fun platformer for the NES in which you control either character from the bottom to the top of high vertical levels. Once you start climbing up your path, the screen will start scrolling automaticly and you must rush 'cause if you touch the bottom of the viewport you will have to start over, losing a life.

The game features 1P and 2P modes, both co-operative and VS.
